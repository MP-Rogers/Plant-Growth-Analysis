# Irish Moss Cultivation Project

This project serves as a preliminary attempt to begin the cultivation of Irish Moss at the Discovery Bay Marine Lab. This document outlines some of the rationale, methods and procedures and results undertaken during the course of this project.

## Background

Jamaica has been noted to have some of the most overfished waters in the Caribbean. At the same time the territory has ***THIS MANY*** fisherfolk who are experiencing less income as a result of the lower quantites of smaller lower quality fish which are caught.

At the same time, environmental degredation from development, climate change and the ecosystem effects of overfishing further reduce the sustainability and productivity of the fisheries sector.

## Introduction

## Rationale

## Methods

For this project, *Eucheuma cotonii*, one of many species of seaweed commonly known as irish moss, was grown using two methods in the Discovery Bay Area.

A small scale off bottom and line method were used in the same area to cultivate the *Eucheuma* over a six week period as suggested by the literature.

The Off-Bottom method was adapted from previous efforts by the Discovery Bay Marine Lab to cultivate *Eucheuma*. Two pieces of iron rebar were driven into the sandy substrate using a combination of a hammer and body weight. A rope was run between the two rebar posts by untwisting the rope and running the rebar through the gap. This was followed by tying the remaining length to further secure the rope.

**IMAGE**

For the raft method, a small raft was constructed. This raft consisted of two metre long 3/4" PVC pipes capped with 3/4" PVC caps at the ends. four 2.5 metre 5mm polypropene ropes were.

## Observations and Results

### Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

## Discussion

## Further Recommendations for Future study
