# Irish Moss Cultivation Project

This project serves as a preliminary attempt to begin the cultivation of Irish Moss at the Discovery Bay Marine Lab. This document outlines some of the rationale, methods and procedures and results undertaken during the course of this project.

## Background

Jamaica has been noted to have some of the most overfished waters in the Caribbean. At the same time the territory has ***THIS MANY*** fisherfolk who are experiencing less income as a result of the lower quantities of smaller lower quality fish which are caught.

At the same time, environmental degradation from development, climate change and the ecosystem effects of overfishing further reduce the sustainability and productivity of the fisheries sector.

## Introduction

## Rationale

+ Potential income earner
+ Ease fishing pressure and let stuff recover
+ More funding to marine park and sanctuaries
+ Potential value added products

## Aims and Objectives

There are several aims and objectives undertaken with this project:

1. To attempt to grow commercially important seaweed species locally
    1. To determine suitable conditions for growing Irish moss locally in Jamaica
    1. To determine methods of cultivation which work best in a Jamaican context
2. To quantify the mean growth rate of the seaweed
3. To determine the potential profitability of cultivating seaweed in Jamaica


## Methods

For this project, *Eucheuma cotonii*, one of many species of seaweed commonly known as irish moss, was grown using two methods in the Discovery Bay Area. These methods were a Floating Raft Method and an Off-Bottom Method.Both cultivation set ups same area to cultivate the *Eucheuma* over a six week period as suggested by the literature.

The Off-Bottom method was adapted from previous efforts by the Discovery Bay Marine Lab to cultivate *Eucheuma*. Two pieces of iron rebar were driven into the sandy substrate using a combination of a hammer and body weight. A rope was run between the two rebar posts by untwisting the rope and running the rebar through the gap. This was followed by tying the remaining length to further secure the rope.

**IMAGE**

For the raft method, a small raft was constructed. This raft consisted of two metre long 3/4" PVC pipes capped with 3/4" PVC caps at the ends. four 2.5 metre 5mm polypropene ropes were drilled through to ropes. Buoys were used to keep the raft afloat, but bottle floats should also be a viable alternative. Cement blocks were used to anchor the whole structure, one at each corner of the raft (although adjacent Rafts could share anchors)

## Observations and Results

```{r}
#| warning: false
#| echo: false
library(tidyverse)
library(ggpubr)
library(lubridate)
library(plotly)
library(readxl)
dataset <- read_excel("Seaweed Data.xlsx")
```

```{r}
#| warning: false
#| echo: false
names<-colnames(dataset)
  names[4]<-"Mass"
  names[5]<-"Day"
  #names[5]<-"Length"
  colnames(dataset)<-names
  dataset$Identifier<-as.factor(dataset$Identifier)
  dataset$Method<-as.factor(dataset$Method)
  dataset$Day<-as.Date(dataset$Day, format= "%d/%m/%Y")
  #data<-dataset
  #glimpse(data)
```



```{r}
#| warning: false
#| echo: false
#| fig-cap: Figure 1 showing change in mass of seaweed over time
  data<-dataset
  #print(summary(data))
  #glimpse(data)
  p<- data %>% ggplot(mapping=aes(x = Day, y = Mass, colour = Identifier))+
    geom_point(alpha = 0.6, size = 1.8, shape = data$Method)+
    geom_line(alpha = 0.6)+
    #geom_abline(intercept = 17.39, slope = 0.1068)+#taken from a linear model
    #Maybe add an aesthetic for species
    labs(title = "Mass of Seaweed Samples at Different Days", x="Day", y="Mass(grams)")
  p.interactive<-ggplotly(p, tooltips = c("x","y", "text"))
  p.interactive
```


The graphs go here. Clearly, I'll need to mention growth, but i have graphs and math for that



I'll need to mention non quantitative observations too:

1. Ice-Ice
1. Cleaning
1. Fragmenting/Reserve Stock
1. Colour changes



### Running Code


You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

## Discussion

## Further Recommendations for Future study

+ More Sites
+ More Species
+ More Samples
